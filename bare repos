# Bare repository
* 
A bare repository is a Git repository that does not have a working directory. Unlike a standard Git repository, which contains a .git directory along with a working copy of the project files, a bare repository consists solely of the .git directory contents, including all the version history, branches, and tags, but no checked-out copies of the files.

## why is it needed?
* Central collaboration poin
* No direct modifications to the workingfiles.
* Good for server-side repos
* Bare repositories are often used in CI/CD systems where automated systems need to fetch code changes but do not require a working copy of the code.
